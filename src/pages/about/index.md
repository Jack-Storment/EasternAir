### How it Started

Eastern Air is focused on helping customers in N.C. reach budget friendly solutions to their specific HVAC needs. Based out of Apex, NC with 25+ years in the HVAC/R industry and 3rd generation in the field we have the experience needed to accomplish your HVAC goals.

We offer a variety of products to reduce contaminates in the air circulating inside your home. At Eastern Air we understand customers needs and budgets differ and will work with you to find the best solution to the opportunity at hand.

### History

Eastern Air is a three generation, locally owned, family business here in Apex, NC. We work hard day in and day out to make sure the members of our community are comfortable in their own home.

We provide service and maintenance for all brands of equipment in both residential and commercial applications. We also provide installation on most brands primarily American Standard. With todayâ€™s indoor air quality concerns we also offer several products for home or business to reduce contaminants in the air circulating inside.

### Innovation in the Industry

One of our gold standards of HVAC has been American Standard. American Standard provides whole home comfort with heating and cooling, air quality, and smart home solutions. Up to 72 trillion allergens can find their way into your home every day and the average home generates 40 pounds of dust per year. This is why we only provide the best equipment.



If you've been thinking of adding new heating, cooling, or refrigeration to your home, we would love to help you explore the best products we offer on the market. In addition to heating and cooling systems, products like air filters and humidifiers work non-stop to improve the overall quality of the air to help you breathe in fresh air everyday.
